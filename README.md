# Emergence of Order from Disorder: Turing Pattern Formation  in Reaction-Diffusion Models 
*Cem Özen*

This repository is created to present simple numerical experiments based on mathematician Alan Turing’s theory of pattern formation. The basis of this theory is diffusion-driven instability of a steady state. In diffusion-driven instability, the linearly steady state of a dynamical system made of two diffusable, interacting species goes unstable upon the introduction of diffusion under certain conditions; hence, the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition from a spacially homogenous to a non-homogenous distribution. 

Numerical examples I present in this work belong to the Gray-Scott and the Brusselator systems.
