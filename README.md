# pattern_formation_in_reaction-diffusion_systems
This repository is created to present simple numerical experiments based on mathematician Alan Turingâ€™s theory of pattern formation. The basis of this theory is diffusion-driven instability of a steady state. In diffusion-driven instability, the linearly steady state of a dynamical system made of two diffusable, interacting species goes unstable with the inclusion of diffusion; hence the system undergoes a symmetry-breaking transition from a spacially homogenous to a non-homogenous distribution. (Turing, 1952). Examples I present here are from the Gray-Scott and the Brusselator systems.
